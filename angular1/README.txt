Advanced Developer Interview - Angular Exercise

Introduction
----------------------------

The files, "index.html" and "app.js" comprise a partially-complete,
simple AngularJS application. The goal of this exercise is to write
the code necessary to complete the application.

Once completed, the application displays a list of famous comedians
from days of Vaudeville and the Golden Age of Hollywood. In addition to
the comedian's name, the list also contains the comedy group he or she
belonged to as well as a link to the comedian's Wikipedia page
for more information. The application also contains a search box
for filtering comedians by name.

Throughout the HTML and JavaScript source files, you will find several
comments. These comments will provide direction for completing the
assignment.



Additional Information
----------------------------

The version of Angular used in this exercise is 1.5.3.

This exercise should be completed and returned within three days after
it was assigned.

Feel free to use any resource (online, book, etc...) you would like
to complete this exercise. It's completely fine to ask Google for help.
However, we do ask that the code you submit be your own. It doesn't help
anyone to turn in someone else's code.
