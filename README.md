# Angular vs Aurelia

Comparison of Angular 2 and Aurelia

Some notes:
* I started with a very simple Angular 1.x. I've included it in the
Angular1 directory.
* I'm still learning frameworks, so I'm sure I'm doing something (or everything) wrong.
* I tried to the simplest apps that I thought would still be within the style of each framework.
* For Angular 2, I use typescript and for Aurelia, javascript 2016. These seem to be the preferences for each framework.
* I used their respective versions of a “quick start” application shell for each framework. Particularly for angular this means there are way more dependences than are actually used.
* You will need to run “npm install” on the Angular 2 project.
* You will need to run "jspm install" on the Aurelia project.
* You can run the angular 2 project by doing an “npm start”
* You’ll need a web server for the aurelia project. (they recommend: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server and that’s what I used.)
